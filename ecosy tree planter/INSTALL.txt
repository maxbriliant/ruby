On Linux you have to add your ruby binary into $PATH

For Example:
echo "export PATH=/home/$USER/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:$PATH"
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/chromedriver" >> ~/.bashrc

Chrome Webdriver need to be Installed
Note: On Linux they need to be added into your PATH Variable too

                                ## WARNING - USE VERSION OF YOUR BROWSER ##
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/107.0.5304.18/chromedriver_linux64.zip 
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo cp ./chromedriver /usr/bin
sudo cp ./chromedriver /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 755 /bin/chromedriver && sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/chromedriver

sudo ln -s /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome /usr/bin/google-chrome
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/google-chrome

To make $PATH changes permanently, write into your .bashrc
